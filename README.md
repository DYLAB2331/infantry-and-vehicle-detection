# Infantry & Vehicle Detection

![](https://github.com/DYLAB2331/infantry-and-vehicle-detection/blob/main/test.gif)

C++ program that takes in an input video and uses a custom trained VOLOv5l model to detect and track infantry and military vehicles. The model was trained on a set of drone images from the Russo-Ukrainian War and then converted to ONNX format. The program depends on a CUDA-enabled build of OpenCV, which must be built with CMake.
